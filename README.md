# MY LEARNING LIST TOWARDS DATABASE SYSTEMS

## PRE
I SUMMARIZE THE LEARNING PROCESS INTO THREE HUGE PARTS

1.first part should be the basic parts, which is to dive deep into a traditional database system, for this purpose I choose [MYSQL](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) to be. During the process I plan to learning network, storage and computing solving at least 10 community issue

- [x] done or not (expected to be done before 02/2024)

2.learning JIT, which is the second part, JIT and Query Compilation should be the most interesting part of database learning, the process starts with comprehensive learning of [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) I should at least make 10 useful MR to LLVM and then try best to do query compilation on MYSQL(hard on ha)

- [x] done or not (expected to be done before 05/2024)

3.learning stream system including [materialize](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize) and learning about [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink)

- [x] don or not (expected to be done before 11/2024)


as for vectorization? who cares if we could do query compilation?
